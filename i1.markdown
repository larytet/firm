The market is protecting sensitive systems attached to the Internet/Intranet.

Examples of such systems:
* Equipment on the military plants
* Sensitive WEB servers
* Infrastructure installations (water meters, etc)
* Any embedded device with LAN connectivity
* CT, MRI, US, PET equipment in hospitals

The product targets non-IP devices - mainly legacy devices which employ proprietary protocols. 
The product can target 10Gb/s line rate. The existing hardware is a fanless palm size board 
with passive heat sink and two 10GB/s interfaces https://github.com/larytet/firm/blob/master/hardware.jpeg

Among the features that can be supported at line rate:

* Drop packets base on the RegExp match and protect sensitive systems against malformed packets. 
* VLAN tag/untag based on RegExp match. Simplifies management multiple devices.
* Modification of the packet header - MAC source/destination address. Example - multiple devices with the same MAC source addrress. 
* Add/remove an IP header in the packets matching specific RegExp. Converts non-IP packets created by legacy devices to IP packets which can be routed by existing IP infrastructure.

Appears, that there is no high performance equipment which works with non-IP (non-IP is a 
crucial part) packets. It appears also that a large military equipment company really wants 
to get a solution (to the tune of 2mil USD order). I do not know what the company is, but I
suspect that this is one of the largest - Rafael or similar. It appears also that the 
existing limited software based solutions (snort, ngrep, etc.) lack:
*  Performance
*  Flexibility
*  A convenient UX/UI to configure advanced filtering rules, like in 
"draw your packet using your mouse" and we will do the rest.

No one of the major players - Cisco, Juniper, F5 can do the trick. I did not check Huawei.

There is a company which can provide the whole stack from the core logic to the WEB interface. 
Or, alternatively, a 2-3 capable guys could do it in 0.5 year time frame. 
I think that I could make beta version of the software - a full stack from FPGA to a nice 
WEB front end - in half an year. A production grade version in one year.
